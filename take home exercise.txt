Your job is to create a small foreign exchange portfolio app. You'll have 4 JSON data sources to ingest:

portfolio.json - a list of portfolios. Each contains a name, a nationality and a list currencies in various denominations
CurrencyCode.json - a list of currencies and what country they are associated with
Country.json - a list of Nationalities and the CurrencyCode associated with that country
A live exchange rate feed: http://openexchangerates.org/api/latest.json?app_id=925b5c034e404a678862b0ea49a2fab6

Write JS+HTML app that takes the input from the above sources and lists each person's name, nationality and the total value of their portfolio in the currency of their home country. The list of portfolios should be sorted by their intrinsic value. Objective is to see your process and coding/learning skills. Documentation of code might be important.
If possible use github to post your code and host it.
